<p>Use Ansible Galaxy to download and install geerlingguy.haproxy role in <em>roles/</em>. Create a playbook <em>haproxy.yml</em> that runs on servers in the <strong>proxy</strong> host group and does the following: * Use geerlingguy.haproxy role to load balance request between hosts in the <strong>webservers</strong> host group. * Use roundrobin load balancing method. * HAProxy backend servers should be configured for HTTP only (port 80). * Firewall is configured to allow all incoming traffic on port TCP 80.</p>
<p>If your playbook works, then doing “curl http://ansible-2/” should return output from the web server (see task #14). Running the command again should return output from the other web server.</p>
<p>Run the playbook and provide the output in the text file to the tutor. Provide all files you've created as well.</p>
