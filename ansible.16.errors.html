<p>Create a playbook <em>html.yml</em> that does the following: * Playbook downloads http://INVENTOY_HOSTNAME/index.html on localhost. Do it 2 times: 1. Use <em>ignore</em>errors_ to avoid playbook failure. Download file to /home/ansible/INVENTORY_HOSTNAME-1 2. Use <em>block</em> to avoid failure: 1. Output &quot;File downloaded&quot; if attempt succed 2. Configure the playbook to handle failure by outputting &quot;The file doesn't exists!&quot; 3. Configure the playbook to output &quot;Attempt completed&quot; to stdout whether it was successful or not</p>
<pre><code>   Download file to /home/ansible/INVENTORY_HOSTNAME-2</code></pre>
