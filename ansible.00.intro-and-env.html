<p><strong>Ansible</strong> is an open source automation tool used to configure servers, install software, and perform a wide variety of IT tasks from one central location. It is a one-to-many agentless mechanism where all instructions are run from a control machine that communicates with remote clients over SSH, although other protocols are also supported.</p>
<p>5 VMs will be used in this course. One VM will be configured as an Ansible control node. Other four VMs will be used to apply playbooks:</p>
<pre><code>1. ansible-control – Ansible control node
2. ansible-2 – managed host
3. ansible-3 – managed host
4. ansible-4 – managed host
5. ansible-5 – managed host</code></pre>
<p>ansible-5 server has a 1GB secondary /dev/sdb disk attached.</p>
