<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a playbook <em>regular_tasks.yml</em> that runs on servers in the <strong>proxy</strong> host group and does the following:
<ul>
<li>A root crontab record is created that runs every hour.</li>
<li>The cron job appends the file <em>/var/log/time.log</em> with the output from the <strong>date</strong> command.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a playbook <em>at_tasks</em> that runs on servers in the <strong>database</strong> host group and does the following:
<ul>
<li>Make sure <em>at</em> package is installed and <em>atd</em> service is running</li>
<li>An at task for root is created that checks disk space (df -h) and saves result in <em>/tmp/diskspace</em>. Task should be started in 20 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Run playbooks, make sure both jobs (cron and at) exist, and provide the output in the text file to the tutor. Provide all files you've created as well.</p>
